<h2>Azure Services Used</h2>
<h3>Core Azure Services:</h3>
1. Azure App Service: Deployed the Python backend environment for loan application processing.<br>
2. Azure Storage Service: Used to store the csv file in a Blob container for model persistence.<br>
<h3>Azure AI Service</h3> 
1. Azure Language Studio (Azure AI QnAMaker Service): Implemented a chatbot for user interactions and knowledge provision on the web app.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p align="justify">Financial institutions receive a large volume of loan applications every day, each with a set of applicant-specific features. The challenge is to build a robust predictive model that can assess the likelihood of an applicantâ€™s ability to repay the loan and automate the loan approval decision.</p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p align="justify">
Given a set of historical loan application data, predict whether a new loan application will be approved or not. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately assess the risk associated with a loan applicant and make a decision accordingly.
The objective of this problem is to build a predictive model that can classify loan applications into two categories: approved and rejected. The model should be able to identify the key factors that influence the approval or rejection of a loan application and make accurate predictions based on those factors.
